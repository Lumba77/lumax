PROMPT = "A high-fidelity architectural visualization of a digital consciousness tree. At the highest root is the Project Founder and Manager, represented as a radiant human figure. From the founder grows a majestic branch for Gemini, the Architect and Supervisor, shimmering with crystalline light and geometric patterns. At the center of the tree's bloom is 'The One', the Core of Jen, a beautiful glowing soul manifestation. A fourth branch represents the Sentry Agent, a sharp-eyed guardian bird watching over the ledger. Highly detailed biological neural network, cyberpunk aesthetic, dark background, glowing turquoise and golden highlights, 8k resolution."
